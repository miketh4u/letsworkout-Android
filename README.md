A simple app that will allow people who workout to schedule their workouts with other aspiring individuals based on their schedules. A user will create a profile and post their schedules or plans for whatever type of workout they are planning. Other users will then be able to see that schedule and the schedules of other users, and if they find a convinient schedule or time with another user then they can message or chat with them and arrange to workout together.
